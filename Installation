Version Java 1.8 or jdk11, but suggested jdk11

Java For Windows & Env Vrbls:
-----------------------------

1. download from Oracle site
2. search for jdk-11, windows x-64 Installer
3. create account in oracle, and download .exe, install
4. we need to set up ENV-varbls (other tools need to know 	where the java is)
5. select the java installed dir path (C/pgmfls/Java/jdkxxx)
6. Now, rightclik on This PC & go to my properties - advanced settings
7. again advanced
8. select User variabels and select New, give var name: JAVA_HOME, 
for Systems variables, var value:paste the path(ex:C/prmfls/Java/jdk-11xx) and add /bin in the end of that path and click ok.

open cmd prmt & check:
java --version


MAVEN for Windows & Env Vrbls:
------------------------------
1. Maven download from apache.org (3.8.6)
2. decide the respective path and extract the downloaded file, install
3. and the same as above, set up env. varibls.. user var: M2_HOME
Sys var: click path, add new path and add /bin at the end, and click ok
open cmd prmt & check:
mvn --version, it displays java version as well.

For Linux:
----------
connect to your linux server
1. yum install java.
or download java file to your windows and copy the file to linux using winscp
for that,
1. go to oracle site and download bin..tar.zip Linux x64 Compressed Archive, give the account details for oracle and download.
2. got to linux server, connect to it from putty
3. cd /opt/ and create dir java.. mkdir java
3. cd /opt/java
4. copy that jdk software into this java directory.

using winscp:
-------------
-download winscp from official site (winscp.net)
-install it in your windows

1. go to the downloads and copy tha tar.giz file and paste it in your target path.
2. take the Linux server IP (hostname -I)

- now open winscp,
  give linux server IP addrss,
  mention user name, give passwd and login
- left side is windows pane and right is linux
- select the required pathh and drag and drop
- use drag and drop option. its all. (it works vice versa as 	well)
- extract the file in linux server, using tar -xvf filename

setting Variables in Linux: there are many ways.
-----------------------------------------------
Java:
------ 
- now to go the same file path ex: /opt/java/jdk-11.x.x
- create a script in the given respective path for,
	Java:
	create a file, vi /etc/profile.d/java.sh
	add these 2 lines in that file,
		export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/jdk-11.0.16xxx
		export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

-  now run the script using, source /etc/profile.d/java.sh
-  check the java version using, java --version


MAVEN:
-----
- go to maven.apache.org
- downnload maven, .bin.tar.gz file
- copy into the respective path in your windows
- and in linux we want it in lets say /opt/maven
- open winscp, and match the dir, drag and drop the file
- extract the file using, tar -xvf filename
- open that directpry and hit pwd and set-up the envi varbls
- script:
	MAVEN:
	create a file in,     /etc/profle.d/maven.sh
	copy these 2 lines, 
		export M2_HOME=/opt/maven/apache-maven-3.8.6
		export PATH=${M2_Home}/bin:${PATH}

- now run the script using, source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

- now check maven using, mvn --version




cmds reference:

tar -xvf .tar.gz
for extracting a gz file

tar -tvf file.tar.gz
to view the file content without extracting

tar -cvf filename.tar.gz directoryname
to make a directory into .tar.gz file
